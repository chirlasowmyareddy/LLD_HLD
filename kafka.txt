-Apache kafka is a distributed streaming platform.
-Allows application to send,store, and process data in real time.
-Apache kafka is an open source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance
data pipelines,streaming analytics,data integration,and missing-critical applications

Benifits Of Using kafka
-Scalability:handle large amounts of data
-Fault Tolerance:replication of data
-High Throughput:Capable of processing millions of messages per second
-Durability:Reliable storage of messages

Key Components of kafka
    Topics- a kafka topic is like a "channel" or "category" where messages(data) are published.Think of it as a folder 
        that holds all the messages belonging to a specific stream of data.
            -when you send a message to kafka,you choose which topic to send to.
            -consumers can subscribe to that topic to receive the messages
    Producers-An application or process that sends events to kafka topics.producers write data to kafka
    Consumers-An application or process that reads events from kafka topics
        consumers subscribe to topics and process the data
    Brokers-when you run kafka,you start one or more "broker" processes.It is basically the server(or node)in a kafka cluster
        -stores messages
        -Handle Read/write requests
    Partitions-a Partition is a sub section of a kafka topic.Topics can have multiple partitions so data can be spread out
        across brokers
        -each Partition maintains a sequential order of messages,allowing parallel read and write for higher performance.

Some other key words which are used in Kafka
    Kafka Offset-It is a sequential number assigned to each message within a Partition.Think of it like page numbers in a
        book.
        Offsets are unique per Partition,helps in tracking
        -the kafka broker assigns the offset not the producers
        -maintains order(per partition):messages always read in order within a partition
        -tracks consumer progress-consumers store their last read offset to resume processing
        -supports message replay:consumers can rewind or seek to reprocess older messages
        -stored in kafka(__consumer__offsets):kafka tracks offsets internally,unless configured otherwise.
        Retention affects Offsets:If a message exceeds kafka's retention period,it may no longer exist.
